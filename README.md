# Cub3D
A graphic design project.

## Summary: 
This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which
was the first FPS ever. It enabled me to explore ray-casting. The goal was to
make a dynamic view inside a maze.

*As a graphic design project, cub3D helped me to improve my skills in these
areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.\
*Cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics.
